MoneyTracker is a simple Django app, to help keep track of communal expenses during group events (such as ski trips).

Functionality outline:

- creation of an event and a group of participants
- entry of expense records, under the name of the participant who paid for the expense
- entry of balance transfer records, between two participants
- calculation of the running total (all expenses)
- calculation of the individual split (total divided by number of participants) 
- calculation of each participant's contribution variance (overpayment or underpayment)

=======================

It must be noted that Excel / Google Docs spreadsheets have been more than adequate to achieve this task.

I have created a web-app version for the sole purpose of racking up experience points with Django and a handful of other technologies! :)
